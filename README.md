## 🌐 System Architecture

The system consists of several key components working together to provide comprehensive threat detection:

### 🛠️ Web Crawler
- Built with Scrapy and AIOHTTP
- Intelligent proxy rotation
- Respects robots.txt
- Configurable crawl patterns

### 📝 Feature Extraction
- BERT-based text analysis
- OpenCV image processing
- URL pattern analysis
- Metadata extraction

### 🧪 Machine Learning Pipeline
- Transformer models for text analysis
- Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- Custom rule engine
- Ensemble learning approach

### 📂 Data Storage
- Snowflake for structured data
- S3/GCS for large binary objects
- Optimized query patterns
- Data versioning
